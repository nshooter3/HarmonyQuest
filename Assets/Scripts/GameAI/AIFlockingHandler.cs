            Wij = max(dmax - dij, 0)     (Wij = 2d matrix for avoidance weights between all agents, dmax = max distance at which flocking will activate, dij = distance between two agents)
            Fca = Sum(wi * Normalize(p - pi))      //(collision avoidance force) [wi = Wij, j is constant] p = my position pi = neighbor position
            F = Fp + Fca * Wca     (weight of collision avoidance [given]) Fp = already existing movement vector

            First, generate a 2d weight matrix for all agents based on their proximity to each other if it is within a specified range (NavigatorSettings.collisionAvoidanceMaxDistance).
            Agents that are closer to one another will have stronger weights, and agents that are too far away will not affect one another at all.
            Second, use the 2d weight matrix and agent positions to generate a net collision avoidance force for each agent that pushes them away from the other agents.
            Third, set each agent's collision avoidance force using their SetCollisionAvoidanceForce functions.

            Obstacle avoidance is the same thing, but between agents and obstacles instead of agents and other agents.
